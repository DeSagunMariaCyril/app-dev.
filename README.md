| ----------- | ----------- |
| Anna | Anna is more daring than graceful and, at times, can act before she thinks.|

| Marshmallow | Marshmallow is an enormous icy snowman born from Elsa’s powers.|
| Oaken | Oaken runs Wandering Oaken’s Trading Post and Sauna. But since Elsa’s massive winter storm hits in mid-July, he finds himself with a surplus of summer supplies.|
